# Based ML models
written from scratch(some are even without numpy)

## About
Implenemtation of some basic ML algorithms with some other stuff, like hyperparams search, model tests. 
Also some basic information about models, but it is on Russian. Anyways formulas and ideas are correct.

## Implemented algorithms
* KNN
  + basic KNN
  + weighted KNN
  + Parzen window algorithm
  + Potential functions method
* STOLP algorihtm of choosing support objects from dataset
* Probability based models
  +  Naive Bayes method
  +  Plug-in algorithm
  +  LDA
  +  Radial basis functions net method of splitting mixtures of distributions
  +  Additional method for multivariate normal distribution visualizing
* Basic linear models
  + ADALINE
  + Rosenblatt perceptron
  + Logistic regression
  + SMV
  + Nadaraya-Watson model(nonparametrical regression)
